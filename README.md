Image to Sketch Converter


Introduction


The Image to Sketch Converter is a web application that transforms ordinary photographs into artistic sketch renderings using computer vision techniques. Built with Flask and OpenCV, this project provides an intuitive interface for users to upload images and convert them into different sketch styles with just a few clicks.
Purpose and Functionality
In the digital age, transforming photographs into sketches has become a popular way to create artistic interpretations of images. While professional graphics software can accomplish this task, they often require technical expertise and can be expensive. This application bridges that gap by offering a simple, accessible solution for creating sketch art from photographs.
The application offers three distinct sketch styles:

Pencil Sketch: Creates a realistic pencil drawing effect with appropriate shading and texture.
Detailed Edges: Focuses on extracting and highlighting the key edges and contours in the image.
Contour Drawing: Produces a clean outline-based representation of the image.

Technical Overview
The project utilizes:

Flask: A lightweight web framework that handles routing, file uploads, and rendering templates
OpenCV (cv2): A powerful computer vision library that performs the image processing algorithms
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend technologies that create a responsive, user-friendly interface

The image processing pipeline employs various techniques including grayscale conversion, Gaussian blurring, edge detection, and adaptive thresholding to achieve different sketch effects.
Target Audience
This tool is designed for:

Artists seeking inspiration or base sketches for their work
Students learning about digital image processing
Social media enthusiasts looking to create unique content
Educators who want to incorporate creative visual elements in their materials
Anyone interested in transforming their photos into artistic sketches
